Strip Optimization Tool for Windows pandoc-ui

USAGE:
    .\scripts\strip_optimize.ps1 [OPTIONS] -BinaryPath <path> [-Level <level>]

PARAMETERS:
    -BinaryPath <path>    Path to the executable file to optimize (required)
    -Level <level>        Optimization level (optional, default: Conservative)

OPTIMIZATION LEVELS:
    Conservative         Safe optimizations (recommended for PySide6)
                        - UPX compression disabled (Qt compatibility)
                        - Safe PE optimizations only
                        - 5-15% size reduction
                        - No functionality risk
                        
    Moderate            Balanced optimization
                        - Light UPX compression (test required)
                        - Advanced PE optimizations
                        - 10-25% size reduction
                        - Low functionality risk
                        
    Aggressive          Maximum compression
                        - Aggressive UPX compression
                        - Maximum PE optimizations
                        - 15-40% size reduction
                        - High risk for Qt applications

OPTIONS:
    -Verbose             Enable verbose output
    -Backup              Create backup before optimization (default)
    -NoBackup            Skip backup creation
    -Test                Test mode - show what would be done
    -Verify              Verify executable functionality after optimization
    -Help                Show this help message

EXAMPLES:
    .\scripts\strip_optimize.ps1 -BinaryPath "dist\windows\pandoc-ui.exe"
    .\scripts\strip_optimize.ps1 -BinaryPath "dist\windows\pandoc-ui.exe" -Level Conservative
    .\scripts\strip_optimize.ps1 -BinaryPath "dist\windows\pandoc-ui.exe" -Level Moderate -Verbose -Verify
    .\scripts\strip_optimize.ps1 -BinaryPath "dist\windows\pandoc-ui.exe" -Test

NOTES:
    - UPX compression may trigger antivirus software
    - Qt/PySide6 applications are sensitive to aggressive compression
    - Always test the optimized executable before distribution
    - Conservative level is recommended for production use
